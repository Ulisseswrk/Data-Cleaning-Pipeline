# Data Cleaning and Enrichment Project 🧹✨

This project focuses on transforming raw data into a clean, structured dataset ready for analysis. Using the **Pandas** library in Python, we tackle common issues in customer registration datasets such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to prepare a **customer registration dataset** for further data analysis by identifying and correcting data quality issues, ensuring the information is accurate, consistent, and ready for insights.

---

## 🛠️ Techniques Used

- **Pandas** 🐼: Core library for all data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation tasks.  
- **Handling Missing Values** ❓: For simplicity, rows with missing (null) values are dropped to maintain dataset quality.  
- **Identifying and Removing Duplicates** 🔍: Duplicate records are detected and removed to prevent skewing results.  
- **Standardizing Formats** 🧾: Includes converting data types, normalizing text (capitalization), and formatting dates uniformly.  
- **Creating New Variables (Enrichment)** ✨: Generating new columns from existing data, e.g., calculating age from birth date, for deeper insights.  
- **Handling Inconsistencies** 🔧: Correcting illogical or out-of-standard data entries to maintain dataset integrity.
