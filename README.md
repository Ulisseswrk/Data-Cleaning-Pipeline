# Data Cleaning and Processing Project with Pandas

## 📝 Project Description

This project implements a comprehensive data cleaning and processing workflow using the `pandas` library in Python. The goal is to prepare datasets for subsequent analysis by ensuring data quality, consistency, and integrity. The script handles everything from initial data loading and inspection, through handling missing values and duplicates, to standardizing formats and creating new derived columns. The final output is a clean, reliable dataset ready for further analytical tasks.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Guarantee data quality and consistency throughout the dataset.
- Identify and appropriately handle missing data and duplicates.
- Standardize formats and correct inconsistencies across columns.
- Generate new insights by creating meaningful derived features.
- Export a clean dataset optimized for future analyses.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** — Programming language.
- **Pandas** — Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **NumPy** — Numerical computing support library.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Then install the required libraries via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
